(Narator);I went to the beach that day. Enjoying sunset once in a while can heal the unseen damage I received at work, I thought. But that day was quite different. ;;:Set_Background(Pembuka_Beach,0);;;;;
(Narator);At first, I thought I heard it wrong. Why would you hear a baby’s cry on the beach? But as I approached, it’s becoming impossible to dismiss the sound as my hallucination. ;;;;;;;
(Narator);I found a crying baby inside a cardboard wrapped in a blanket. When I tried to touch the baby, the skin felt cold to touch. I tried to search for an identity that can identify the child, but no—none.;;;;;;;
;So, I decide to bring the baby to the police office. ;;;;;;;
(Narator);The police were surprised. They hurriedly helped me by making a milk for the baby. While the other officer tried to find any missing notice about the baby. But it was futile, because there was no one’s looking for the baby. So, the police suggest to send the baby to the orphanage.;;:Set_Background(Pembuka_Police_Office,0);;;;;
(Narator);I look at the baby that was sleeping. I thought perhaps, I could try to raise the baby. So, I told the officer. They were surprised but then they helped me with the paperwork.;;;;;;;
